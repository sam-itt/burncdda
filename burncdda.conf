#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the burnCDDA config file.
# For system wide configuration copy it to /etc/burncdda.conf
# For user specific configuration copy it to ~/.burncdda
#
# burnCDDA is a shell script for burning Audio-CDs with cdrdao
# and cdrecord.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# MAIN OPTIONS
#

# Color settings:
# Some output is colored. Choose if these colors should be
# "BRIGHT" (if you have a dark terminal background),
# "DARK" (if you have a bright terminal background)
# or if "NO" colors should be used.
# Default: COLORS="BRIGHT"
COLORS="BRIGHT"

# Image directory:
# Decoded files and ripped CD images will be saved in this directory.
# If you want to use a single directory for all users be sure that
# every user has write access to it.
# Default: IMGDIR="${HOME}/cdda"
IMGDIR="${HOME}/cdda"

# Nice level for decoding, normalizing and ripping
# (only values between 0 and 19 for non-root users).
# Higher value = lower priority
# Default: NICELEVEL="5"
NICELEVEL="5"

#
# CD WRITING OPTIONS
#

# Permissions
# If you have permission errors when attempting to burn a cdrom or dvd image,
# such as the following:
#   /usr/bin/cdrecord: Operation not permitted. Cannot send SCSI cmd via ioctl
# then cdrecord almost certainly needs root privileges to work correctly.
# One potential solution is to make the cdrecord and cdrdao binaries suid root,
# but this has possible security implications. The safest way to do that is 
# to make those binaries suid root, owned by a specific group, and executable
# by only root and members of that group. For most people, the example below
# will be sufficient (but adjust as desired depending on your specific needs):
#   chown root:cdrom /usr/bin/cdrecord /usr/bin/cdrdao
#   chmod 4750 /usr/bin/cdrecord /usr/bin/cdrdao
# If you don't want all members of the 'cdrom' group to be able to execute the
# two suid binaries, then create a special group (such as 'burning' which is
# recommended by k3b), use it instead of 'cdrom' in the line above, and add
# to it only the users you wish to have access to cdrecord and cdrdao.

# Writing speed
# This defaults to '16' at the moment because most drives (except very old
# ones) can write at this speed and it should provide a good writing
# quality. Even old car CD players should play the CDs. Otherwise you can
# use '-1' and let cdrecord use its internal drive specific maximum speed
# defaults.
# Default: WRITESPEED="16"
WRITESPEED="16"

# CD writer device (try 'cdrecord -scanbus' or 'cdrecord -scanbus dev=ATAPI').
# Examples: "0,0,0" or "ATAPI:0,0,0" or "/dev/hdc" or "/dev/sr0"
# The right setting depends on your kernel version and configuration.
# You need at least cdrdao 1.1.8 to use atapi drives without ide-scsi.
# You probably also have to load the sg module: 'modprobe sg'
# Default: DEVICE="/dev/cdrom"
DEVICE="/dev/cdrom"

#
# CDRDAO SPECIFIC OPTIONS:
#

# Driver for CD reader
# Try 'man cdrdao' for more info.
# The generic-mmc driver should work with almost every CD writer.
# Default: DRVRDAO="generic-mmc"
DRVRDAO="generic-mmc"

# Driver for CD writer
# Default: DRVWDAO="generic-mmc"
DRVWDAO="generic-mmc"

# Parnoia mode for audio CDs
# Take a look at the cdrdao documentation for more information.
# (0 = no paranoia)
# Default: PARANOIAMODE="0"
PARANOIAMODE="0"

#
# CDRECORD SPECIFIC OPTIONS
#

# cdrecord driver options
# (try 'cdrecord dev=X,X,X -checkdrive driveropts=help')
# Example (Plextor PX-W4012A):
# burnfree        Prepare writer to use BURN-Free technology
# noburnfree      Disable using BURN-Free technology
# varirec=val     Set VariRec Laserpower to -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
#                 Only works for audio and if speed is set to 4
# forcespeed      Tell the drive to force speed even for low quality media
# singlesession   Tell the drive to behave as single session only drive
# nosinglesession Disable single session only mode
# hidecdr         Tell the drive to hide CD-R media
# nohidecdr       Disable hiding CD-R media
#
# burnfree is recommened for buffer underrun protection.
# Default: DRIVEROPTS="driveropts=burnfree"
DRIVEROPTS="driveropts=burnfree"

# Writing modes
# Not all writers can use the same writing modes, so you can try dao, sao, tao, raw...
# Take a look at cdrecord man page for more information.
# CD-AUDIO (default: "-raw")
WMODE="-raw"
# CD-EXTRA, session 1: audio (default: "-raw")
WMODEEXTRA1="-raw"
# CD-EXTRA, session 2: data (many CD writers only support tao, default: "-tao")
WMODEEXTRA2="-tao"

# Other options
# Try dao, sao or tao if raw doesn't work.
# Default: OTHERREC="-v -pad defpregap=0"
OTHERREC="-v -pad defpregap=0"

#
# NORMALIZE OPTIONS
#

# Normalize to amplitude
# Try 'man normalize' for help.
# Quick help:
# '-12dbfs': very low volume, recommended for classical music
# '-10dbfs': burnCDDA default, medium output volume, recommended for pop/rock
#  '-8dbfs and above': high output volume, will surely result in clipping
# You can search the web for 'volume race' to get more information about
# output volumes and why you should not set it too high.
# Default: NORMAMP="-10dbfs"
NORMAMP="-10dbfs"

# CD-Recording tools
# If you want to use cdrkit instead of cdrtools try CDRECORD="wodim"

# MPlayer is the new standard decoder.
# It can do high quality resampling if necessary and should be fine for

# Old decoders
# You can use the old decoders instead of MPlayer.
# Set to "NONE" if you want to use MPlayer for decoding
# To use the old decoders try these:
# mpg321, oggdec, flac, mppdec, sox
# Example: FLACDEC="flac" or FLACDEC="NONE"

# EXPERTS PATH SECTION
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usually all programs are in $PATH and you don't have to change anything
# here. burnCDDA is tested on Linux with the GNU versions of the unix
# standard tools. If you are not running a GNU system (BSD, Solaris, ...)
# and having problems with burnCDDA, you should install the GNU tools and
# adjust the pathes.

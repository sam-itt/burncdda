Permissions:
If you have permission errors when attempting to burn a cdrom or dvd image,
such as the following:
  /usr/bin/cdrecord: Operation not permitted. Cannot send SCSI cmd via ioctl
then cdrecord almost certainly needs root privileges to work correctly.
One potential solution is to make the cdrecord and cdrdao binaries suid root,
but this has possible security implications.  The safest way to do that is 
to make those binaries suid root, owned by a specific group, and executable
by only root and members of that group.  For most people, the example below
will be sufficient (but adjust as desired depending on your specific needs):
  chown root:cdrom /usr/bin/cdrecord /usr/bin/cdrdao
  chmod 4750 /usr/bin/cdrecord /usr/bin/cdrdao
If you don't want all members of the 'cdrom' group to be able to execute the
two suid binaries, then create a special group (such as 'burning' which is
recommended by k3b), use it instead of 'cdrom' in the line above, and add
to it only the users you wish to have access to cdrecord and cdrdao.
